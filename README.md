# Separating Axis Theorem Demo
## Running The Demo
To run the interactive demo simulation:
1. Download all the files from GitHub. Unzip is necessary.
2. Make sure all the files(`index.html`, `libsat.js` and `webrender.js`) are in the same folder. 
3. Drag and drop the `index.html` into a browser. 

## Files
`index.html` is the HTML for the webpage. <br />
`webrender.js` controls all the user interaction on the webpage and makes it interactive. <br />
`libsat.js` Library for the separating axis theorem. Has the polygon and point classes. Polygon class is used for a polygon created by points and determines if they are hitting. Point class is just an object with property x and y. <br />
